# Module 1.2: Setting Up the Development Environment

**Objective:** By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- **Install** the correct versions of Node.js and npm.
- **Install** the Angular CLI globally.
- **Configure** a recommended IDE (VS Code) with essential extensions.
- **Verify** that the entire development environment is set up correctly.

### The Core Stack

A professional Angular development workflow relies on three key pieces of software:

1.  **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment. (Recommended LTS version: 20.x or higher)
2.  **npm (Node Package Manager):** A package manager for JavaScript libraries. (Comes with Node.js, usually 10.x or higher)
3.  **Angular CLI:** The official command-line interface for Angular. (Recommended version: 17.x or higher)

This diagram shows how they fit together:

    C --> D[Angular CLI (Global)];
    B --> E[Development Server (Local)];
    C --> F[Project Dependencies (Local)];
```

**Text Summary of Core Stack:**

Your machine runs the Node.js runtime, which includes npm. npm is used to install the Angular CLI globally and manage project-specific dependencies. The Node.js runtime also powers the local development server for your Angular application.

### 1. Installing Node.js and npm

**Why you need it:** The Angular CLI and the local development server are built on top of Node.js. npm is required to download and manage all the third-party libraries (dependencies) your project will use, including Angular itself.

**Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to the Official Website:** Open your browser and go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). **Always download from the official source to ensure security and stability.**
2.  **Download the LTS Version:** You will see two versions available: LTS and Current. **Always download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version.** It is the most stable and is recommended for all production environments.
3.  **Run the Installer:** Follow the on-screen instructions provided by the installer.
4.  **Verify the Installation:** To confirm that Node.js and npm have been installed correctly, open your terminal (like Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Check the installed Node.js version
    node -v

    # Check the installed npm version
    npm -v
    ```

    You should see the version numbers printed to the console, for example: `v20.11.0`.

    **Note on Updating:** If you have an older version of Node.js, it's recommended to uninstall it first or use a version manager like **nvm (Node Version Manager)** to avoid conflicts.

    **Troubleshooting:**
    - If the commands don't return version numbers, ensure Node.js was installed correctly and your system's PATH environment variable includes the Node.js installation directory. Restarting your terminal or computer can sometimes resolve PATH issues.
    - **Windows:** The installer usually handles the PATH setup automatically.
    - **macOS/Linux:** If you installed via a package manager (like Homebrew or apt), the PATH should also be configured. If you installed manually, you might need to add `export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH` to your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent shell profile.

### 2. Installing the Angular CLI

The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is your primary tool for interacting with an Angular project. It automates dozens of tasks and enforces best practices.

**Why you need it:** The CLI handles project creation, code generation (components, services, etc.), running tests, building for production, and much more. It is an essential part of the modern Angular workflow.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Globally:** Use npm to install the Angular CLI package globally on your system. The `-g` flag makes the `ng` command available from any directory in your terminal.

    ```bash
    npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

    **Note on Updating:** To update your global CLI to the latest version, you can run the same command again.

    **Global vs. Local CLI:** Installing the CLI globally (`-g`) allows you to use `ng` commands from any directory. However, each Angular project also has a local CLI dependency listed in its `package.json`. This ensures that projects built with older CLI versions can still be maintained, as the local CLI version will be used when running commands from within that project's directory.

2.  **Verify the Installation:** After the installation is complete, verify it by running:

    ```bash
    ng version
    ```

    This command will display a detailed overview of your Angular environment, including the versions of the CLI, Node.js, and other key dependencies.

    **Troubleshooting:** If the `ng` command is not found, ensure npm's global package directory is in your system's PATH. You can find the global path by running `npm list -g --depth=0` and checking the first line of output. You might need to restart your terminal.

### 3. Recommended IDE and Extensions

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can dramatically improve your productivity. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is the de facto standard for web development today.

**Alternatives:** While VS Code is highly recommended, other popular IDEs for Angular development include WebStorm (paid, powerful) and Sublime Text (lightweight, customizable). Consider accessibility features in your editor of choice if needed.

1.  **Download VS Code:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2.  **Essential VS Code Extensions:** Open VS Code, go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), and install the following:

    *   **Angular Language Service:** **This is non-negotiable.** It provides IntelliSense (intelligent code completion), error checking, and navigation inside your Angular templates. [Install Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template)
    *   **Prettier - Code formatter:** Automatically formats your code on save to ensure a consistent, clean style across your project. This is critical for team collaboration. To enable format on save, go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Code > Settings` on macOS), search for `editor.formatOnSave`, and enable it. [Install Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    *   **ESLint:** A static analysis tool that finds and helps you fix problems in your TypeScript code before you even run it. [Install Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
