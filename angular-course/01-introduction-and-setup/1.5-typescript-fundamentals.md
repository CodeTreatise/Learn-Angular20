# Module 1.5: TypeScript Fundamentals for Angular

**Objective:** By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- **Explain** why TypeScript is essential for modern Angular development.
- **Use** basic TypeScript types like `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.
- **Define** the shape of complex objects using interfaces.
- **Create** classes with properties, methods, and access modifiers.
- **Recognize** and understand the role of decorators like `@Component` and `@Injectable`.

### Why TypeScript?

Angular is built with TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Using TypeScript is not optional in Angular; it's a core part of the framework. It provides several key benefits that improve code quality and maintainability:

*   **Type Safety:** Catches errors during development (e.g., passing a `string` where a `number` is expected) rather than at runtime.
*   **Superior Tooling:** Enables powerful features like intelligent code completion, refactoring, and navigation.
*   **Modern JavaScript Features:** Allows you to use the latest JavaScript features (from ES2015 and beyond) and compiles them down to code that runs in all supported browsers.

### Core TypeScript Concepts

This is not an exhaustive TypeScript guide, but it covers the fundamental concepts you will encounter daily in Angular. For a comprehensive guide, refer to the [Official TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/).

#### 1. Types

Types allow you to declare the expected data type for variables, function parameters, and function return values.

**Syntax:** `let variableName: type = value;`

**Common Primitive Types:**

*   `string`: Textual data (e.g., `'Hello, World!'`)
*   `number`: Numeric values (e.g., `42`, `3.14`)
*   `boolean`: `true` or `false`
*   `any`: A dynamic type that opts out of type checking (use sparingly!).
*   `null`, `undefined`: Types for `null` and `undefined` values.

**Type Inference and Union Types:**
- **Type Inference:** If you declare and initialize a variable at the same time, TypeScript can often infer the type for you (e.g., `let framework = 'Angular';` is inferred as `string`).
- **Union Types:** You can specify that a variable can be one of several types using the `|` operator (e.g., `let id: string | number;`).

**Example:**

```typescript
let framework: string = 'Angular';
let version: number = 20;
let isStable: boolean = true;

// This will cause a compile-time error!
// version = 'twenty'; 
```

#### 2. Interfaces

An interface is a way to define a custom type, or a "code contract," for the shape of an object. It ensures that any object claiming to be of that type has the required properties.

**Syntax:**

```typescript
interface ModelName {
  propertyName: type;
  anotherProperty?: type; // The ? makes it optional
}
```

**Example:**

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email?: string; // Optional property
}

// Interfaces can be extended
interface Admin extends User {
    role: 'admin';
}

const myUser: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'John Doe'
};

// This will cause a compile-time error because 'id' is missing.
// const invalidUser: User = {
//   name: 'Jane Doe'
// };
```

#### 3. Classes

Classes are the primary building blocks of Angular components, services, and directives. They are blueprints for creating objects.

**Key Features:**

*   `constructor`: A special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.
*   `properties`: Variables that belong to the class.
*   `methods`: Functions that belong to the class.

**Access Modifiers:**
- `public`: (Default) Can be accessed from anywhere.
- `private`: Can only be accessed from within the class itself.
- `protected`: Can be accessed within the class and by classes that inherit from it.

**Example:**

```typescript
class DataService {
  // private property, cannot be accessed from outside
  private data: string[] = ['first', 'second'];

  // public method, accessible from anywhere
  getData(): string[] {
    return this.data;
  }

  addData(item: string): void { // void means it doesn't return anything
    this.data.push(item);
  }
}

const service = new DataService();
console.log(service.getData()); // Output: ['first', 'second']
```

#### 4. Decorators

Decorators are a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class, method, or property. They are functions that are prefixed with an `@` symbol and are used to add metadata or modify the behavior of the thing they are attached to.

**You will see decorators everywhere in Angular.** Other common examples include `@Input()` and `@Output()` for component communication.

**Example:**

```typescript
// The @Component decorator tells Angular that this class is a component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  // ... class logic
}

// The @Injectable decorator marks a class as available to be provided and injected as a dependency.
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService {
  // ... service logic
}
```

This foundational knowledge of TypeScript is sufficient to get started. You will naturally become more familiar with these concepts as you build Angular applications. For deeper learning, refer to the [official TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

### Quick Quiz

1.  What is the main advantage of using TypeScript over plain JavaScript in an Angular project?
    a) Faster execution speed
    b) Compile-time type checking
    c) Simpler syntax

2.  Which decorator is used to define a class as an Angular component?
    a) `@Injectable()`
    b) `@NgModule()`
    c) `@Component()`

3.  What does an interface in TypeScript define?
    a) The implementation of a class
    b) The shape of an object (a code contract)
    c) A new variable

### Quiz Answers

1.  **b) Compile-time type checking:** This helps catch errors early in the development process.
2.  **c) `@Component()`:** This decorator provides the metadata that Angular needs to treat a class as a component.
3.  **b) The shape of an object (a code contract):** Interfaces are used to ensure objects have a specific structure.
