### 2. Troubleshooting Guide

Here are some common issues you might encounter during Angular development and how to resolve them.

#### a) "Cannot find name 'process'" or "Buffer is not defined"

*   **Issue:** This often occurs in Angular 12+ when using Node.js-specific global variables (`process`, `Buffer`) in browser-side code, especially with older libraries that might not be fully browser-compatible.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **For `process`:** Install `npm install --save-dev @types/node` and add `"node"` to the `types` array in your `tsconfig.app.json` (or `tsconfig.json`).
    2.  **For `Buffer`:** You might need to polyfill it. In `polyfills.ts`, add `(window as any).Buffer = Buffer;` and ensure `Buffer` is imported from `buffer` (`import { Buffer } from 'buffer';`). You might also need to configure `webpack.config.js` if you're ejecting or using custom webpack.
    3.  **Check Library Compatibility:** Ensure the library you are using is intended for browser environments.

#### b) "ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError"

*   **Issue:** This error occurs when Angular detects that a component's property has changed *after* change detection has already run for that component in the same cycle. It's a common error in development mode and indicates a potential issue with data flow or an infinite loop in change detection.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Avoid Modifying Data After View Init:** Do not modify component properties that are bound to the template in `ngAfterViewInit` or `ngAfterViewChecked` directly. If you must, wrap the change in a `setTimeout(() => { ... }, 0);` or use `ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()` (use sparingly).
    2.  **Ensure Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data should flow down from parent to child. Events flow up from child to parent. Avoid circular dependencies.
    3.  **Use `OnPush` Strategy:** As discussed in Module 10.4, `OnPush` can help prevent this by making change detection more predictable.

#### c) "NullInjectorError: No provider for [Service]!"

*   **Issue:** Angular's Dependency Injection system cannot find a provider for a requested service.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **`providedIn: 'root'`:** Ensure your service has `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` if it's meant to be a singleton available application-wide.
    2.  **`app.config.ts`:** For standalone applications, ensure the service or its feature provider is listed in the `providers` array of `app.config.ts` (e.g., `provideHttpClient()`, `MyService`).
    3.  **Component-level Providers:** If the service is only needed by a specific component and its children, ensure it's listed in the `providers` array of that component's `@Component` decorator.
    4.  **Correct Import:** Double-check that you have correctly imported the service in the component or service that is trying to inject it.

#### d) CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Errors

*   **Issue:** Your frontend (running on one origin, e.g., `localhost:4200`) is trying to make an HTTP request to a backend API on a different origin (e.g., `localhost:3000`), and the browser blocks the request for security reasons.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Backend Configuration:** The most robust solution is to configure your backend API to send appropriate CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) to allow requests from your Angular application's origin.
    2.  **Angular CLI Proxy:** During development, use the Angular CLI's proxy configuration (Module 15.4) to forward API requests through the development server, bypassing CORS issues.

#### e) Build Errors After `ng update`

*   **Issue:** After updating Angular to a new major version, your project might fail to build due to breaking changes or deprecated APIs.
*   **Solution:**
    1.  **Read Update Guide:** Always read the official Angular update guide (update.angular.io) for the specific version you are upgrading to. It lists all breaking changes and migration steps.
    2.  **Use `ng update` with `--migrate-only`:** This flag runs automated migrations that fix many common breaking changes.
    3.  **Check Deprecations:** The CLI will often warn about deprecated features. Address these warnings proactively.
    4.  **Consult Community:** Search Stack Overflow, Angular forums, or GitHub issues for similar problems.
