# Module 10.5: Performance Optimization Techniques

**Objective:** To explore various techniques and best practices for optimizing the performance of Angular applications, focusing on initial load times, runtime performance, and bundle size.

---

### The Importance of Performance

Application performance is critical for user experience, engagement, and business success. Slow applications lead to user frustration, higher bounce rates, and lower conversion rates. Optimizing performance involves reducing load times, ensuring smooth interactions, and minimizing resource consumption.

### 1. Initial Load Time Optimizations

Reducing the time it takes for your application to become interactive is crucial.

#### a) Lazy Loading Modules/Components

*   **Concept:** Load parts of your application only when they are needed (e.g., when a user navigates to a specific route). This significantly reduces the initial bundle size that the browser has to download and parse.
*   **Implementation:** Covered in Module 5.5. Use `loadChildren` in your routing configuration.

#### b) Preloading Strategies

*   **Concept:** After the initial application loads, you can preload other lazy-loaded modules in the background during idle time. This makes subsequent navigations to those modules instantaneous.
*   **Implementation:** Covered in Module 5.5. Use `withPreloading` and `PreloadAllModules` or a custom strategy.

#### c) Image Optimization

*   **Concept:** Images often account for a large portion of page weight. Optimize them by:
    *   **Compressing:** Use tools to reduce file size without significant quality loss.
    *   **Resizing:** Serve images at the appropriate dimensions for the display area.
    *   **Lazy Loading Images:** Use `loading="lazy"` attribute on `<img>` tags or a library to load images only when they enter the viewport.
    *   **Modern Formats:** Use formats like WebP or AVIF for better compression.

#### d) Font Optimization

*   **Concept:** Web fonts can also contribute to load times. Optimize by:
    *   **Subsetting:** Include only the characters you need.
    *   **Font Display:** Use `font-display: swap` to prevent text from being invisible during font loading.

### 2. Runtime Performance Optimizations

Ensuring your application remains fast and responsive during user interaction.

#### a) `OnPush` Change Detection Strategy

*   **Concept:** As discussed in Module 10.4, `OnPush` significantly reduces the number of change detection cycles by only checking components when their inputs change (by reference), an event originates from them, or an `async` pipe emits.
*   **Best Practice:** Use `OnPush` for most of your components and ensure you are working with immutable data structures.

#### b) `trackBy` Function with `@for` (formerly `*ngFor`)

*   **Concept:** When rendering lists with `@for`, Angular re-renders the entire DOM list if the underlying data array changes (even if only one item is added/removed). The `trackBy` function provides a hint to Angular to identify unique items in the list.
*   **Benefit:** Angular can then efficiently add, remove, or reorder only the DOM elements that have changed, instead of re-rendering the entire list.

**Example:**

```typescript
// In your component class
interface Item { id: number; name: string; }
items: Item[] = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item A' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item B' }
];

trackById(index: number, item: Item): number {
  return item.id; // Return a unique identifier for each item
}
```

```html
<!-- In your template -->
<ul>
  @for (item of items; track trackById) {
    <li>{{ item.name }}</li>
  }
</ul>
```

#### c) Detaching Change Detector (`ChangeDetectorRef`)

*   **Concept:** For highly optimized scenarios, you can detach a component's change detector from the change detection tree. This means Angular will no longer check this component (and its children) automatically.
*   **Use Case:** When you have a component that updates very infrequently or only based on specific, controlled events. You then manually re-attach or mark for check when needed.
*   **Caution:** Use with extreme care, as it can easily lead to stale UI if not managed correctly.

```typescript
import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy, ChangeDetectorRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  standalone: true,
  selector: 'app-detached-component',
  template: `<p>Data: {{ data }}</p><button (click)="updateData()">Update</button>`,
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush // Often used with OnPush
})
export class DetachedComponent {
  data: number = 0;

  constructor(private cdr: ChangeDetectorRef) {
    this.cdr.detach(); // Detach the change detector
  }

  updateData(): void {
    this.data++;
    this.cdr.detectChanges(); // Manually trigger change detection for this component
  }
}
```

#### d) RxJS Operators for Event Throttling

*   **Concept:** For events that fire rapidly (e.g., `mousemove`, `scroll`, `keyup`), you can use RxJS operators to control how often your code reacts.
*   **Operators:**
    *   `debounceTime()`: Emits a value only after a specified period of inactivity.
    *   `throttleTime()`: Emits a value, then ignores subsequent values for a specified period.
    *   `distinctUntilChanged()`: Only emits if the current value is different from the last.
*   **Implementation:** Covered in Module 8.2.

### 3. Bundle Size Optimizations

Smaller bundles download faster, leading to quicker initial load times.

#### a) Tree Shaking

*   **Concept:** The process of removing unused code from your final JavaScript bundle. Modern build tools (like Webpack, used by Angular CLI) analyze your code and eliminate functions, classes, or modules that are imported but never actually used.
*   **How Angular Helps:** Standalone components and `providedIn: 'root'` services are inherently more tree-shakable because their dependencies are explicitly declared.

#### b) Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation

*   **Concept:** Angular applications are compiled during the build process (AOT) rather than in the browser at runtime (JIT - Just-in-Time).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Faster Rendering:** The browser downloads pre-compiled code, so it can render the application immediately.
    *   **Smaller Bundles:** The Angular compiler can perform more optimizations and remove unused Angular code.
    *   **Earlier Error Detection:** Template errors are caught at build time, not runtime.
*   **Default:** AOT compilation is the default for production builds (`ng build --configuration production`).

#### c) Minification and Uglification

*   **Concept:** Reducing the size of your JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files by removing whitespace, comments, and shortening variable names.
*   **Default:** Handled automatically by the Angular CLI for production builds.

#### d) Webpack Optimizations

*   The Angular CLI uses Webpack under the hood. It applies various optimizations like code splitting (for lazy loading), common chunk extraction, and asset optimization.

#### e) Build Configuration (`angular.json`)

*   Review your `angular.json` file for production build settings. Ensure `optimization`, `budgets`, and `outputHashing` are configured appropriately.

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. By applying these techniques, you can significantly improve the speed and responsiveness of your Angular applications, leading to a better experience for your users.
