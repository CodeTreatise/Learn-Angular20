# Module 15.1: Angular Material

**Objective:** To introduce Angular Material, a UI component library that implements Google's Material Design, and learn how to use it to build beautiful, consistent, and accessible user interfaces.

---

### The Challenge of UI Development

Building a user interface from scratch can be time-consuming and challenging. It requires:

*   **Design Expertise:** Creating visually appealing and intuitive layouts.
*   **CSS Skills:** Writing and maintaining complex CSS for various components.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensuring components are usable by everyone, including those with disabilities.
*   **Responsiveness:** Making sure the UI adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring consistent behavior across various browsers.

### The Solution: UI Component Libraries

UI component libraries provide pre-built, tested, and accessible UI components that you can drop into your application. They abstract away much of the complexity of styling, behavior, and accessibility, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

**Angular Material** is Google's official UI component library for Angular. It implements **Material Design**, a comprehensive design system developed by Google, which provides guidelines for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices.

#### Advantages of Angular Material:

*   **High Quality Components:** Provides a rich set of well-designed, production-ready UI components (buttons, cards, forms, navigation, data tables, etc.).
*   **Material Design Adherence:** Ensures your application follows Google's Material Design guidelines, leading to a consistent and modern look and feel.
*   **Accessibility Built-in:** Components are built with accessibility (a11y) in mind, following WCAG standards, including proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
*   **Theming:** Offers a powerful theming system to customize colors, typography, and density to match your brand.
*   **Responsiveness:** Components are designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
*   **Active Development:** Actively maintained and updated by the Angular team.

### Getting Started with Angular Material

1.  **Add Angular Material to your project:**
    Use the Angular CLI to add Angular Material. This command will guide you through the setup process.

    ```bash
    ng add @angular/material
    ```

    The CLI will prompt you to:
    *   **Choose a pre-built theme:** Select one of the provided themes (e.g., `Deep Purple/Amber`). You can customize this later.
    *   **Set up global typography styles:** Choose `Yes` to include global Material Design typography.
    *   **Include browser animations:** Choose `Yes` to enable animations (requires `BrowserAnimationsModule` or `provideAnimations()`).

2.  **Import Individual Components:**
    Angular Material is modular. You import only the components you need, which helps keep your bundle size small. Each component has its own `NgModule` (e.g., `MatButtonModule`, `MatCardModule`).

    In a standalone component, you import these modules directly into the `imports` array.

    ```typescript
    // src/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button'; // Import specific component module
    import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';
    import { MatInputModule } from '@angular/material/input';
    import { MatFormFieldModule } from '@angular/material/form-field';

    @Component({
      standalone: true,
      selector: 'app-my-component',
      imports: [
        MatButtonModule, // Add to imports array
        MatCardModule,
        MatInputModule,
        MatFormFieldModule
      ],
      templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
      styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
    })
    export class MyComponent { }
    ```

3.  **Use Components in Your Template:**
    Once imported, you can use the Material components in your HTML template.

    ```html
    <!-- src/app/my-component/my-component.component.html -->
    <mat-card>
      <mat-card-header>
        <mat-card-title>Material Card</mat-card-title>
        <mat-card-subtitle>A simple example</mat-card-subtitle>
      </mat-card-header>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This is content inside a Material card.</p>
        <mat-form-field appearance="fill">
          <mat-label>Your Name</mat-label>
          <input matInput placeholder="Ex. John Doe">
        </mat-form-field>
      </mat-card-content>
      <mat-card-actions>
        <button mat-raised-button color="primary">Like</button>
        <button mat-button>Share</button>
      </mat-card-actions>
    </mat-card>

    <button mat-flat-button color="accent">Click Me</button>
    ```

### Theming Your Application

Angular Material provides a flexible theming system based on Sass. You can define custom color palettes, typography, and density.

1.  **Custom Theme File:** Create a custom theme file (e.g., `src/theme.scss`).

    ```scss
    // src/theme.scss
    @use '@angular/material' as mat;

    // Define a custom primary and accent palette
    $my-primary: mat.define-palette(mat.$indigo-palette);
    $my-accent: mat.define-palette(mat.$pink-palette, A200, A100, A400);

    // Create a theme. You can choose light or dark.
    $my-theme: mat.define-light-theme((
      color: (
        primary: $my-primary,
        accent: $my-accent,
      ),
      typography: mat.define-typography-config(),
      density: 0
    ));

    // Apply the theme
    @include mat.all-component-themes($my-theme);
    ```

2.  **Include Theme in `angular.json`:**

    ```json
    "styles": [
      "src/styles.css",
      "src/theme.scss" // Include your custom theme
    ],
    ```

### Accessibility (A11y) with Angular Material

One of the biggest advantages of Angular Material is its strong focus on accessibility. All components are built to meet WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards, including:

*   **Semantic HTML:** Uses appropriate HTML elements.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Automatically applies necessary ARIA attributes for assistive technologies.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Provides built-in keyboard interaction patterns.
*   **Focus Management:** Handles focus correctly for interactive elements.

By using Angular Material, you get a significant head start in building accessible applications, reducing the manual effort required to meet accessibility standards.

Angular Material is an indispensable tool for rapidly building high-quality, consistent, and accessible user interfaces in your Angular applications. It allows you to focus on your application's unique features rather than reinventing common UI elements.
